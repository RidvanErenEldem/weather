## How to use

First of all, you need to create a api key for your application from weatherapi.com after that create a file named ".env" in your root directory and add it to your api key like so:

### `REACT_APP_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY`

After adding the api key you need to start backend with the following command

## `npm start:backend`

After backend started you can start the frontend of the application and use it with the following command

## `npm start:frontend`

The backend will be started on port 8000 and frontend will be on port 3000.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the frontend in your browser.
